This is a quick review of the tools available in the UIL Toolbox.   These tools generally present data from **SquareSpace Collections**.   Collections are files of either Blogs or Events.

## Carousel

The Carousel is an infinint loop of entries in a collection with previous and next
buttons on the left and right.  The number of items displayed can be defined as an
attribute when calling the carousel function.  Filtering (to limit items) based on SquareSpace categories is also available via attributes. [Learn More about carousels](../components/carousel.html).

This will display a SquareSpace collection (blog or events) as a grid with optional
filtering based on defined groups (see reference-data).  [Learn More about grids](../components/grids.html).

## Embedded Iframe

You can embed a page from the UIL website into the page of a separate website.  When this is done, headers and footers are hidden with "display:none" CSS attribute. Otherwise this is a basic iFrame embed and initial height/width will be honored.  [Learn More about Embedding Iframes](../components/iframe.html).
